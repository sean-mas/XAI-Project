    "### 1.1 Business Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In the modern digital age, social media platforms like Twitter have become primary channels for customers to express their opinions, share feedback, and voice concerns about products and services. This generates a massive, continuous stream of unstructured text data. For businesses, this data is a goldmine of insights. However, the sheer volume and velocity of this data make it impossible to analyze manually. Businesses that can effectively tap into this stream of public opinion gain a significant competitive advantage."

    "### 1.2 Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The core business problem is the inability to efficiently and accurately gauge public sentiment from social media at scale. Without an automated system, companies are slow to react to negative feedback, miss opportunities to engage with positive customers, and lack real-time data on brand perception and campaign performance. This leads to several risks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reputation Damage:** Unaddressed negative sentiment can quickly escalate and harm brand reputation.\n",
    "- **Poor Customer Service:** Failing to identify and respond to customer complaints leads to dissatisfaction and churn.\n",
    "- **Missed Insights:** Valuable feedback on products and marketing campaigns gets lost in the noise."

    "To address this problem, we will develop a machine learning solution for sentiment analysis. The primary objectives are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Primary Objective:** Develop a deep learning model that automatically and accurately classifies tweets from the Sentiment140 dataset into 'positive' and 'negative' categories.\n",
    "2.  **Secondary Objectives:**\n",
    "    - Provide a mechanism for marketing teams to monitor the sentiment of reactions to new campaigns or product launches.\n",
    "    - Enable customer service teams to build systems that flag and prioritize negative customer interactions for swift resolution.\n",
    "    - Offer product development teams a source of raw, aggregated feedback on feature reception and customer pain points."

    "\n",
    "The success of this project will be measured against both quantitative and qualitative criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quantitative:** The final classification model must achieve a minimum accuracy of **80%** on a held-out, unseen test dataset. This benchmark ensures the model is reliable enough for operational use.\n",
    "- **Qualitative:** The model's outputs and the subsequent analysis should be interpretable and provide actionable insights for a non-technical stakeholder (e.g., a marketing manager or product owner). The project should demonstrate how sentiment trends can be tracked and visualized."

    "3.  **Data Preparation:** Cleaning and preprocessing the text data for modeling.\n",
    "4.  **Modeling:** Building and training a sentiment analysis model.\n",
    "5.  **Evaluation:** Evaluating the model's performance against the success criteria.\n",
    "6.  **Deployment:** Discussing how the model could be deployed in a production environment (conceptual)."
